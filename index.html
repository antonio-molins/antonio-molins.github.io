<h2>Oi, linda!</h2>
<p>This letter is for you, Eve, and for us. It is not an apology, I have already given that to you and I know you wouldn't welcome it again. I have been going over what happened and how we reacted every single day since our last talk while leaving you some space to process, and I see information here that can help you in your process of understanding how and why we co-created this situation. I remain committed to the promise I made to keep you accountable for the creation of your character and reality. Sharing these is part of it.</p>

<p>First, I take full responsibility for what I did: I broke our agreement by going too far with somebody else, then I didn't open up to you when you were showing vulnerability, which disrespected and make you doubt your intuition, and then failed to disclose what I did for two months after that. That said, there is more to this story than a victim and a villain. This relationship we co-created, and I hope that what follows, a reflection of us through me, helps you see how this sequence of events was created by both of us, so that we can both take responsibility, learn, heal, and do amazing in our next relationship, if this one isn't possible to salvage, or better, do amazing together. </p>

<p>Then, about our agreement. Open never was a fuck yes for me. That is the reason I preferred to set strict boundaries, and the reason I asked you not to tell me if you exercised the privilege. I didn't address the topic comfortably whenever you initiated conversations about it, because it did not feel right me that you encouraged me kissing other people. Yet I signed it off, and I take responsibility for not having been more direct about it; I thought that it would be easier and fairer for the privilege to be two-sided. And I did that because I felt safe with you, with us, and felt I could grow into it with you. I can see now that it would have been much better to let you kiss other people, which I never minded, and not extend that permission to me. On your side, if you didn't sense it not being a fuck yes for me, then your intuition failed you. And if you did, then you have some responsibility in the matter. I did help you identify and release yeses that weren't fuck yeses for you in the past, such as your offer to do grocery shopping and cooking together. You holding off to those created strain in the relationship and in your character, and releasing them together improved our relationship and opened up sexy and fun memories in the kitchen. </p>

<p>About what I did in the festival: I should have stopped after the kiss, period. I was exercising my privilege for the first time, a privilege that I wasn't comfortable with to start with, and  I fucked up. This is all on me.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I didn't tell you at the right time, which was immediately after it happened. We had a relationship where I felt very safe to say and do anything, where there was radical candor, where I could trust your reactions. While I get that you noticed a shift in the energetics when I crossed a line, and your intuition was right, your reaction wasn't at all what I would have expected of the type of relationship we were building. You could have told me how you felt and give me time to answer, knowing fully well that I was not going to be as available as I would have normally been. No matter how right your intuition was, blocking me in WhatsApp without even talking to me was avoidant, insecure, not on brand... and made me question your reactions. I missed the opportunity of telling you what happened mostly because I was still processing my guilt (too slowly, I know), because I was in a situation that I did not know how to navigate, and also because I wasn't feeling safe at the time with you. My fear of losing us created a reality in which I did, and your decision of blocking me for four to five days created a reality where it took time for me to tell you something important. Your continuous repeating of this being temporary, your blocking me first time something felt off or not fun, contributed to it becoming temporary. </p>

<p>It took me two months, two months, to get to tell you about it. There is no excuse for that. That said, I did tell you, and told you all the truth, including giving you access to my friend's recounting, because I am neither cheater not a liar. I couldn't hold it inside, I didn't recognise myself in that, to the point that it was changing the way I behaved with you. So I did, and I accept the consequences. Coming clean two months after was infinitely harder than it would have been at the right time, and I did it because I really, really like you, because our relationship is based on respect and truth, because I thought we could go through this together and learn from it, and because I can't hold a lie inside without my character unwinding. Similar to when you blocked me in whatsapp, friends were telling me that I shouldn't, because it was a one-off, because it didn't matter, because there was no "need"... I still did, and would do it again, no matter the consequences. And that is proof that this won't happen again.</p>

<p>You are a great deal, Eve... and so am I. Together we have so, so much potential for a great relationship and partnership. We have a way to see the world through each other eyes that opens up new ways of understanding, and that's rare and precious. To realise that we get to learn together and safely discuss whatever gets to be improved, including this. I don't make the same mistake twice, and learn fast, and so do you. </p>

<p>I am very much open to being open with you. I know we can get back to where we fast, stronger and better.  Forgiveness and growth are sexy.</p>

<p>If you are up for it, you gave me a "get out of jail" card that I still have. We could use that.</p>

<p>And if you are not up for it, then I receive in so, so much gratitude our time together. </p>

<p>You are amazing, prezada.</p>

				<h2>pastesafe helps people share secrets</h2>
				<p>people use pastesafe to encrypt secret messages into links which they can share publicly, but only the intended recipient can decrypt the messages</p>
				<p>pastesafe is technically an rsa+aes hybrid cryptosystem, which can be handy if you need somebody to send you sensitive information like a password or something like that</p>
				<p>all pastesafe links are public. there are two types of pastesafe link. an <em>invite link</em> allows anybody who clicks it to encrypt a message and send it back as a <em>message link</em>, which can only be decrypted by the invite creator</p>
				<h3>all pastesafe communications are initiated by an invite link</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>bob wants to receive secret messages from alice. so, bob creates a pastesafe session and sends her the invite link</li>
					<li>alice clicks the invite link, and is prompted to enter a secret message</li>
					<li>pastesafe automatically encrypts alice's secret message into an encrypted <em>message link</em>. only bob has the key to decrypt it</li>
					<li>alice sends the message link to bob, who clicks to decrypt it</li>
