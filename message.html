        <h2>Oi, linda!</h2>
        <p>This letter is for you, Eve, and for us. It is not an apology, I have already given that to you and I know you wouldn't welcome it again. I have been going over what happened and how we reacted every single day since our last talk while leaving you some space to process, and I see information here that can help you in your process of understanding how and why we co-created this situation. I remain committed to the promise I made to keep you accountable for the creation of your character and reality. Sharing these is part of it.</p>

        <p>First, I take full responsibility for what I did: I broke our agreement by going too far with somebody else, then I didn't open up to you when you were showing vulnerability, which disrespected and make you doubt your intuition, and then failed to disclose what I did for two months after that. That said, there is more to this story than a victim and a villain. This relationship we co-created, and I hope that what follows, a reflection of us through me, helps you see how this sequence of events was created by both of us, so that we can both take responsibility, learn, heal, and do amazing in our next relationship, if this one isn't possible to salvage, or better, do amazing together. </p>

        <p>Then, about our agreement. Open never was a fuck yes for me. That is the reason I preferred to set strict boundaries, and the reason I asked you not to tell me if you exercised the privilege. I didn't address the topic comfortably whenever you initiated conversations about it, because it did not feel right me that you encouraged me kissing other people. Yet I signed it off, and I take responsibility for not having been more direct about it; I thought that it would be easier and fairer for the privilege to be two-sided. And I did that because I felt safe with you, with us, and felt I could grow into it with you. I can see now that it would have been much better to let you kiss other people, which I never minded, and not extend that permission to me. On your side, if you didn't sense it not being a fuck yes for me, then your intuition failed you. And if you did, then you have some responsibility in the matter. I did help you identify and release yeses that weren't fuck yeses for you in the past, such as your offer to do grocery shopping and cooking together. You holding off to those created strain in the relationship and in your character, and releasing them together improved our relationship and opened up sexy and fun memories in the kitchen. </p>

        <p>About what I did in the festival: I should have stopped after the kiss, period. I was exercising my privilege for the first time, a privilege that I wasn't comfortable with to start with, and  I fucked up. This is all on me.</p>

        <p>Afterwards, I didn't tell you at the right time, which was immediately after it happened. We had a relationship where I felt very safe to say and do anything, where there was radical candor, where I could trust your reactions. While I get that you noticed a shift in the energetics when I crossed a line, and your intuition was right, your reaction wasn't at all what I would have expected of the type of relationship we were building. You could have told me how you felt and give me time to answer, knowing fully well that I was not going to be as available as I would have normally been. No matter how right your intuition was, blocking me in WhatsApp without even talking to me was avoidant, insecure, not on brand... and made me question your reactions. I missed the opportunity of telling you what happened mostly because I was still processing my guilt (too slowly, I know), because I was in a situation that I did not know how to navigate, and also because I wasn't feeling safe at the time with you. My fear of losing us created a reality in which I did, and your decision of blocking me for four to five days created a reality where it took time for me to tell you something important. Your continuous repeating of this being temporary, your blocking me first time something felt off or not fun, contributed to it becoming temporary. </p>

        <p>It took me two months, two months, to get to tell you about it. There is no excuse for that. That said, I did tell you, and told you all the truth, including giving you access to my friend's recounting, because I am neither cheater not a liar. I couldn't hold it inside, I didn't recognise myself in that, to the point that it was changing the way I behaved with you. So I did, and I accept the consequences. Coming clean two months after was infinitely harder than it would have been at the right time, and I did it because I really, really like you, because our relationship is based on respect and truth, because I thought we could go through this together and learn from it, and because I can't hold a lie inside without my character unwinding. Similar to when you blocked me in whatsapp, friends were telling me that I shouldn't, because it was a one-off, because it didn't matter, because there was no <i>need</i>... I still did, and would do it again. And that is proof that this won't happen again.</p>

        <p>You are a great deal, Eve... and so am I. Together we have so, so much potential for a great relationship and partnership. We have a way to see the world through each other eyes that opens up new ways of understanding, and that's rare and precious. To realise that we get to learn together and safely discuss whatever gets to be improved, including this. I don't make the same mistake twice, and learn fast, and so do you. </p>

        <p>I am very much open to being open with you. I know we can get back to where we were fast, more powerful than ever.  Forgiveness and growth are sexy. If and when you are up for it, you gave me a <i>get out of jail</i> card that I still have. We could use that. And if you are not up for it, then I receive in so, so much gratitude our time together. </p>

        <p>Eve's character, with all it's wonders and excitement, was born out of Megan's pain. For a while this served you two well, helping you to successfully avoid exposure to pain for years. After a while, though, you had stabilised this level and felt that it was time to grow further. That was beautiful, and I'm so honored that I got to be part of it.</p>

        <p>Outgrowing Eve implied evolution and learning, getting to an Eve 2.0. Your current reaction, taking a step back and retreating to what's familiar, is just more of the Eve 1.0. After our Sunday conversation, where you clearly hadn't processed yet and didn't have the bandwidth to do more than collecting objective facts, we haven't t had a talk where you actively listen to my part of the story. You have only played and replayed a character of me on your mind, a character that gets to be the villain without a chance to speak. Offering a commercial relationship at this point is just retreating to Eve 1.0 without any growth, and that I find surprising and disappointing. </p>

        <p>"Hacking healing" equals "skipping growth". If that's what DMT is teaching you, I'm not interested. "Linear time" is where the real growth happens; the world of ideas, unfettered by consensus reality, gives the illusion of speed and instant but temporary gratification... <i>exactly like a videogame</i>. I know from first experience how it felt to live only in my spacious, beautiful, fully furnished mind, and how much resistance I felt to make the move to the next level. You have gone much farther in the videogame level, but it won't get less empty and temporary over there.</p>

        <p>Connection, vulnerability, and growth take more time and effort and result in much better long term outcomes. It's wonderful here, there are many more colors, emotions, and next level partners. We'll be so, so happy when you join us! I really to the power of really like you, and have an app and an island with your name on it here you are going to love.</p>

        <p>You are amazing, prezada.</p>
